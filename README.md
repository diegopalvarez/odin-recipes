# odin-recipes
Recipes Collection Website.

This project shows the adquisition of the fundamental knowledge of HTML, and will later on be revisited to add my learning of CSS and JS.
The first part of the project, only with HTMl, has already been finished, but later on I will continue working on it and adding more content.

The second part consisted on adding CSS styling to the document. While simple, it means we're one step closer to having all the elements that define a website in the modern days.
