            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

        <h3>Meringue</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 egg whites</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to  325 degrees F (162 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To make the filling: Whisk 1 cup sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt together in a medium saucepan; stir in water, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a boil. Stir in butter.</li>
            <li>Place egg yolks in a small bowl and gradually whisk in 1/2 cup of hot sugar mixture. Whisk egg yolk mixture back into remaining sugar mixture. Bring to a boil and continue to cook while stirring constantly until thick. Remove from heat; pour filling into baked pastry shell.</li>
            <li>To make the meringue: Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over pie filling, sealing the edges at the crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
